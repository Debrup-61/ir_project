Content creation encompasses various activities including maintaining and updating web sites, blogging, article writing, photography, videography, online commentary, the maintenance of social media accounts, and editing and distribution of digital media. In a survey conducted by Pew, content creation was defined as \"the material people contribute to the online world.\"\n"
